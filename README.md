# java-weather-app
This is a Client-Server Java app implemented for a Programming Environments and Tools course at Universitatea Transilvania Brasov. We were tasked with making an application that reads weather data for specific locations from a JSON file, which the user can solicit specific data to visualize and/or update using Socket communication.

⚠️ Note : This code is partially written in Romanian.

🔧 Features
- Client-Server communication
- Command handling through a Get / Set / Exit menu
- Persistent storage of weather data
- Storage of user data using SQLite database
- Multi-threading

🎯 Educational Focus
- Multi-threaded server design
- Socket programming in Java
- Object serialization/deserialization
- Database implementation
- Reading and writing in JSON

📁 Technologies Used
- Java
- Maven

- IntelliJ IDEA

🍏 What I Learned
- Designing and implementing a modular Java application
- Building a socket-based communication system in Java
- Using threads to manage multiple clients simultaneously
- Parsing and manipulating JSON files with SQLite
- Managing a Maven-based multi-module project
